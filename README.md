# LCM_HCF_FOR_MULTIPLE_NUMBERS
finding the lcm and lcm for multiple numbers

In gnereal to find the lcm ( Least common multiple ) of numbers
The lcm could be the largest number or multiple of largest number
ex : 2,4 lcm =4
ex:  6,8 lcm = 24
To implent it in the code we follow the given steps
step 1 : Finding the largest numbers among the numbers.
step 2 : Cheking whether the largest number can be divided with remaining rembers,and continuing  the loop with the multiples of largest number until it divisible by 
            every other input number.
step3: The first number the we get where the number can be divisible by all the other numbers could be the lcm of the given numbers.


In gnereal to find the hcf( highest common factor ) of numbers
The hcf could be the small number or the factors of small number.
ex : 2,4 hcf = 2
ex : 6,8 hcf = 2
To implement it in code we follow the given steps 
step 1 : Finding the smallest numbers among the numbers.
step 2 : Checking whether the least number could divide every other number,and continuing the loop starting from least number to 1 util the number divides each other 
          number.
step 3 : The First number that we get which divides the other numbers is the hcf of the given numbers.
